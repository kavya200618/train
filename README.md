# Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Dataset

## Internship Task 5: Data Analyst Internship

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, discover patterns, and visualize data distributions using statistical and visual exploration methods.

---

## Objective
To explore the Titanic dataset and uncover insights using:
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Steps Performed

1. Data Loading and Cleaning
   - Checked data structure using `.info()`
   - Handled missing values
   - Used `.describe()` and `.value_counts()` for summaries

2. Univariate Analysis
   - Histograms, count plots, box plots

3. Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis
   - Scatter plots, pairplots, and heatmaps

4. Correlation Analysis
   - Used heatmap to show feature correlations

5. Key Observations
   - Higher survival rates among women and children
   - First-class passengers had higher survival probabilities
   - Fare and age had moderate influence on survival

---

## Summary of Insights
- Gender and class played a major role in survival.
- Passengers paying higher fares had slightly better survival chances.
- Age distribution indicated that younger passengers survived more frequently.
